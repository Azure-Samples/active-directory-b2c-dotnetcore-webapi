**There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of the Microsoft identity platform**

Check it out the **TodoListService** Web API of the [ASP.NET Core Web app calling your own API for B2C sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/tree/master/4-WebApp-your-API/4-2-B2C)

If you really need to access this sample, you can navigate to the [master](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-dotnetcore-webapi/tree/master) branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
